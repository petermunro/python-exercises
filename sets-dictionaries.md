# Sets and Dictionaries

Write code to answer these practice questions:

## 1. Creating Sets

a. Create a set, `set1` containing the numbers 1, 2, and 3.

b. Create a set, `set2` from the list `[ 4, 4, 1, 3, 3, 3, 7, 2, 2]`.

c. Create a set, `set3` from all of the uppercase characters in the string `"Present Fears Are Less Than Horrible Imaginings."`

d. Find all of the unique words in this string: `"double, double toil and trouble; fire burn and cauldron bubble."`.

## 2. Set Operations

a. Add the number 4 to `set1`.

b. Remove the number 2 from the set.

c. Check if the number 5 is in the set.

d. Given `set1` and `set2`, find their union, intersection, and difference.

## 3. Frozensets

a. Create a frozenset containing the numbers 1, 2, and 3.

b. Try adding the number 4 to the frozenset. What happens?

## 4. Dictionaries

a. Create a dictionary with keys 'a', 'b', and 'c' and values 1, 2, and 3.

b. Add a key 'd' with the value 4 to the dictionary.

c. Remove the key 'b' and its associated value from the dictionary.

d. Check if the key 'e' is in the dictionary.

e. Loop through the dictionary and print each key-value pair.

f. Given a list of tuples containing student names and their grades, create a dictionary where the keys are the student names and the values are their grades.

## 5. Set and Dictionary Comprehensions

a. Use a set comprehension to create a set of all the even numbers from 0 to 20.

b. Use a dictionary comprehension to create a dictionary where the keys are numbers from 1 to 10 and the values are the square of the keys.

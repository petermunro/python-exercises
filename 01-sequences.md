# Sequences

Write code to answer these practice questions:

## 1. Lists

1. Create a list of the first 10 numbers (0-9).

2. Append the number 10 to the list.

3. Remove the fifth element from the list.

4. Reverse the list.

5. Sort the list.

## 2. Splitting and Joining

1. Given the string `"Python is fun"`, split it into a list of words.

2. Given the list `['Python', 'is', 'fun']`, join it back into a single string.

3. Given a string of numbers separated by commas, e.g., `"1,2,3,4,5"`, convert it into a list of integers.

## 3. Tuples

1. Create a tuple with three elements.

2. Try to change the second element of the tuple. What happens?

3. Convert the tuple into a list.

## 4. Ranges

1. Create a range of numbers from 0 to 10.

2. Convert the range to a list.

3. Use a range to create a list of all even numbers from 0 to 20.

## 5. Common Sequence Operations

1. Given the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, find the index of the number `3`.

2. Check if the number `6` is in the list.

3. Count the number of `3`s in the list `[1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 3]`.

## 6. Slicing

1. Given the list `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, get a slice from index `3` to `7`.

2. Get the last three elements of the list.

3. Get every second element of the list.

## 7. Unpacking

1. Given the tuple `(1, 2, 3)`, unpack it into three variables `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. Try to unpack a list of four elements into three variables. What happens?

## 8. Sequence Modification Operations

1. Given the list `[1, 2, 3]`, change the last element to `4`.

2. Given the list `[1, 2, 3]`, insert `1.5` as the second element.

3. Remove the first element of the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
